!!! info
    All of Nova's regular commands are also **slash commands**.
    It's recommended that you switch to using slash commands for more customizability and regular commands will eventually be deprecated. 

## Notes

- Nova has multiple categorys of commands, each category is layed out in the navbar.
- Have a command idea? Feel free to share it in the Discord server and I'll try and add it.
- If you think something needs to changing, click the edit icon and submit a pull request.
- This may not always be up-to-date, use `-help` for updated commands.
- Use the search bar function to find a specific command.
