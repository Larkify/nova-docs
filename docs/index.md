!!! info
    All of Nova's regular commands are also **slash commands**.
    It's recommended that you switch to using slash commands for more customizability and regular commands will eventually be deprecated. 

## Welcome
*Here you'll find a list of all the commands, how to use them, and what they do. You can also find support links and invite the bot to your server. As always, direct help can be found in my Discord server and if you have questions you can also ask them there.*

## Notes

- Nova has multiple categorys of commands, each category is layed out in the navbar.
- Have a command idea? Feel free to share it in the Discord server and I'll try and add it.
- If you think something needs to changing, click the edit icon and submit a pull request.
- This may not always be up-to-date, use `-help` for updated commands.
- Use the search bar function to find a specific command.
